#Anime Manga Tracker (beta)
Cli tool to download/stream anime/manga from (mainly) official sources

## Install
```
make install
```

## Overview
The goal is to provide an simple and unobtrusive way to consume manga/anime using custom players.
Features
* Steam anime by url -- the same url you would use to watch in a browser
* Register anime and be notified of updates with a single command
* Download all unread episodes/chapters
* Resume interrupted download with no progress loss
* Bring your own anime/manga. The tool works with your personal collection

##Supports

## Why another downloader/tracker
There didn't seem to be adequate alternatives that had the following features
* Supports a wide portion of legal sites
* Integrates with a tracker
* Supports searching for manga/anime among many sites
* Can stream/download with just a series name and chapter/episode number instead of a raw url
* Supports external password managers

## TODO
* Server specific settings
* More cli options for binge reading
* Better support bundling images with different sizes
